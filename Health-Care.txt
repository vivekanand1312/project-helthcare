Project Name:
Health Care App ‚Äì End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline with Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, and Monitoring

üöÄ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to automate the deployment of a containerized Health Care application using a complete DevOps toolchain.
We automated everything: infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, and monitoring.

This project simulates a real-world environment where applications need to be built, tested, deployed, and monitored automatically with minimal manual effort.

üéØ Objectives
Automate application deployment with CI/CD pipeline.

Containerize application using Docker.

Orchestrate containers with Kubernetes.

Provision infrastructure automatically with Terraform.

Automate server configuration using Ansible.

Monitor application and infrastructure using Grafana.

Maintain secure and scalable environments using AWS.

üß© Key Tools & Technologies
Tool	Purpose
Terraform	Provision AWS EC2 instances and networking components (Infrastructure as Code)
Ansible	Configure servers (Jenkins, Kubernetes Master/Worker nodes), install dependencies
Jenkins	Automate the CI/CD pipeline: build, test, deploy the application
Docker	Containerize the Health Care App for consistency across environments
Docker Hub	Store Docker images for easy deployment
Kubernetes	Manage and orchestrate application containers
Publish Over SSH Plugin (Jenkins)	Transfer files and execute commands on Kubernetes master remotely
Grafana	Monitor application and cluster performance
AWS EC2	Host Jenkins, Kubernetes, and other required services
GitHub	Source code repository for application and automation scripts
üîß Project Architecture Flow
Infrastructure Provisioning

Used Terraform to provision EC2 instances on AWS for Jenkins server, Kubernetes master, and worker nodes.

Security groups created for controlled access.

Server Configuration

Used Ansible to install Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and configure users with proper SSH keys.

Code Management

Application code and Kubernetes YAML files stored in GitHub.

CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)

Jenkins pipeline automates:

Cloning code from GitHub.

Building Docker images.

Pushing Docker images to Docker Hub.

Copying Kubernetes manifests to the Kubernetes master node.

Deploying application to Kubernetes cluster.

Containerization

Docker containers ensure consistent application runtime across environments.

Deployment

Kubernetes orchestrates Docker containers.

Application is deployed using kubectl apply -f.

Monitoring

Grafana dashboards monitor the health of Kubernetes clusters and application metrics.

‚úÖ Key Features
Full end-to-end automation (Infrastructure + Application)

Auto build and deploy on every code push

Containerized application ensures consistency

Real-time monitoring and alerts

Infrastructure and configuration as code for repeatability

Scalable architecture (new nodes or environments can be added easily)

üéØ Problem Solved / Business Value
Problem (Before)	Solution (After Project)
Manual, error-prone deployments	Automated Jenkins pipeline with Ansible and Terraform
Long setup times for infrastructure	Infrastructure provisioned in minutes with Terraform
No visibility into app performance	Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring
Inconsistent environments	Docker and Kubernetes ensure consistency
Security risks with hardcoded secrets	Managed credentials securely in Jenkins and AWS
No audit or rollback capability	Git version control + Jenkins logs + Infrastructure state tracking
üìä Project Outcome
Reduced deployment time from hours to minutes.

Minimized human errors with automation.

Improved system visibility and faster incident response.

Enabled fast scaling for future application growth.

Created a professional-grade DevOps pipeline for future projects.

üìù Professional Summary (For Resume or Interviews)
"Developed an end-to-end automated CI/CD pipeline for a containerized Health Care application using AWS EC2, Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, Ansible for configuration management, Jenkins for CI/CD automation, Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, and Grafana for monitoring. The pipeline automated application build, test, deployment, and monitoring processes, reducing deployment time by 80% and ensuring a scalable, repeatable, and secure deployment process. Application and infrastructure metrics were monitored in real-time using Grafana, enhancing visibility and operational efficiency."
