# 🩺 Health Care App - End-to-End DevOps Project

A fully automated CI/CD pipeline for deploying a containerized Health Care application using AWS, Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, and Grafana.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to automate the deployment of an application using infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, and monitoring tools. The goal is to enable fast, repeatable, and reliable deployments while ensuring application performance monitoring.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Cloud:** AWS EC2, Security Groups
- **IaC:** Terraform
- **Configuration Management:** Ansible
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins, Publish Over SSH plugin
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Container Registry:** Docker Hub
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (K8s)
- **Monitoring:** Grafana
- **Version Control:** GitHub

### 🗺️ **2. Architecture Diagram**

Here’s a simple **clean architecture layout**, you can use this in PowerPoint, Notion, or GitHub README using image embed.

If you want, I can also **generate a graphical version** of this (professional PNG/SVG style diagram). ✅

---

### ✅ Optional Add-ons:
- Want me to also prepare a **Project Summary PDF**?
- Or give you **PowerPoint slides** for interviews and demo presentations?
- I can also **generate an architecture diagram image** and give you the file to use anywhere!

---

Would you like me to make a **professional architecture image** for you as well? 📊  
It will be very useful for interviews and showcasing this project visually! 🚀
